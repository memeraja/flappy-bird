# Flappy Bird
It is a side scroller game which I made using Pygame module in Python and the objective is to score by crossing the pipes by jumping!  
Here a more simplified version to instantly start playing

That was a .exe file for Windows.Might launch support for MacOS and Linux Later  
Also looking forward to add implement NEAT ie,Neural Network and Genetic Alogrithms to develop an AI to play this game.
